# sleep-health-analysis-ml
A data analysis and machine learning project exploring how lifestyle factors affect sleep. Includes exploratory data analysis and a linear regression model to predict sleep duration based on variables such as stress level, physical activity, and heart rate.

# Sleep Health & Lifestyle Analysis

This project explores how various lifestyle factors (e.g., stress level, physical activity, BMI) relate to sleep quality and duration. Using Python and machine learning, we performed exploratory data analysis and built a linear regression model to predict sleep duration.

## Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Findings
- Strong correlation between stress level and sleep duration.
- Linear regression model predicts sleep duration with RÂ² = 0.78.

## Machine Learning
We implemented a Linear Regression model to predict sleep duration based on:
- Stress Level
- Physical Activity
- Age
- Heart Rate
